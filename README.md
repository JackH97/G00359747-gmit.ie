# Graph Theory Project - Jack Haugh - G00359747

# Introduction
This repository contains a project from the module Graph Theory for 3rd year software development. It has been written in the Python Programming Language. 
The task set for us was to create a project that had an application made to use regular expressions and matching them using the construction created by kenneth Thompson. It takes an NFA infix and then converts it to a postfix expression using the algorithm shunting. It then uses this to then see if it matches with a string inputted.

# Uploaded 
In this repository it has code from the different parts of our module. The main part is the thompson folder which includes my regex.py and myscript.py 

# Testing & Coding
When typing the code we used google cloud platform and created a server to use for creating different folders on a linux command. When code was typed we then saved and uploaded to individual repositories on github.

# Types of Characters Used
We used various characters when doing the code which range from.

(*) - Kleene Star - This means that a character shows either zero or more times.

. - Concatenate - This means that it will match a character with example a.b means a followed by b.

| - Vertical Bar - This means that with example a|b will be a or b.

# Installation
(please note you must use a linux machine or like us use google cloud and create a linux machine and install python)
1. Git clone https://github.com/JackH97/Graph-Theory-Project
2. cd thompson - This will direct you into my thompson folder with the code 
3. python3 myscript.py - This Command runs the myscript.py file

# Past Repositories
I only put the whole folder together for the project as I had done them in individual repositories in the past. By clicking on these links brings you to the where I did them originally and the commit amount and dates.
