# Graph Theory Project - Jack Haugh - G00359747

# Introduction
This repository contains a project from the module Graph Theory for 3rd year software development. It has been written in the Python Programming Language. 
The task set for us was to create a project that had an application made to use regular expressions and matching them using the construction created by kenneth Thompson. it takes an NFA infix and then converts it to a postfix expression using the algorithm shunting. It then uses this to then see if it matches with a string inputted.

# Uploaded 
In this repository it has code from the different parts of our module. The main part is the thompson folder which includes my regex.py and myscript.py 

# Testing & Coding
When typing the code we used google cloud platform and created a server to use for creating different folders on a linus command. when code was typed we then saved and uploaded to individual repositories on github
